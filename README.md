# Pyosphere

An artificial world simulation, written in Python.

## Description

Pyosphere simulates an artificial world with earth-like conditions. The world is based on a hexagonal grid where the properties of each cell (oxygen, humidity and light) are determined by its elevation.

The actors (agents) in this world are plant cells. Such a cell has its own metabolism and individual requirements of oxygen, humidity and light to survive and produce offspring. These offspring receive the genes of their parent but may incur mutations, possibly changing its metabolism. If the plants are successful, the green carpet will soon expand thoughout the world. Evolution over many generations may even allow the plants to creep up the mountain slopes or to thrive in the sea...

## Future Plans

Where there are plants of course animals are not far. Adding animal cells to this simulation will be the next great step. A whole new layer of complexity awaits when I finally manage to include evolvable neural networks.

***More information following soon. I hope.***
